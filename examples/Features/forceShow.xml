<info><![CDATA[

This is the SearchPane extension for DataTables. It allows results to be filtered based on the values of columns.

This example Demonstrates the `show` option for defining whether a column should show a searchPane or not.
Here we have set the first name Column to have a pane where it would not normally due to the variance, and have hidden the position column which would.

The default value of `show` is undefined so that as standard the searchpanes will be decided on variance.
