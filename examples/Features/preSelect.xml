<info><![CDATA[

This is the searchPanes extension for DataTables. It allows results to be filtered based on the values of columns.

This example shows how to set up the Panes so that some values are pre-Selected. Here the Office column is being targeted and told to preselect 'Edinburgh' and 'London'. This is done by setting the `preSelect` option to be an array of these strings.

The default for `preSelect` is undefined.
