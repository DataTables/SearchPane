<info><![CDATA[

This is the SearchPane extension for DataTables. It allows results to be filtered based on the values of columns.

This example demonstrates the viewTotal option. This option allows the table to display how many values are being displayed, in relation to the total number of values in the table.

`language.searchPane.count` - this is the format of the count column when no filters have been applied to the table.

`language.searchPane.countFiltered` - this is the format of the count column when filters have been applied to the table.

"{total}" - This is the token which is replaced by the total count of that value in the table.

"{shown}" - This is the token which is replaced by the count of each value where that row is being displayed currently. 

The values of the messages shown in this example are the same as the defaults which will be used if only `viewTotal` is set to true and no custom messages are defined.

The default for `viewTotal` is false.
