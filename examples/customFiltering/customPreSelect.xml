<title lib="SearchPanes">Custom Filtering Pane with PreSelections</title>

<info><![CDATA[

This is the SearchPanes extension for DataTables. It allows results to be filtered based on the values of columns.

This example demonstrates the functionality to add custom panes. Panes are populated with custom options which can search the table across multiple columns.

Technically this is also possible to do with a custom function in any of the automatically occurring Panes. This just seems a bit neater.

The `-init searchPanes.panes` config option holds an object for each custom Pane.

Note: `-init searchPanes.panes.preSelect` is not supported with `-init searchPanes.cascadePanes`. This is because in order to have the cascade operate as expected the selections need to be made in the correct order. Currently it is not possible to indicate this with preSelect.
