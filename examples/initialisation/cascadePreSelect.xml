<title lib="SearchPanes">Pre-Select Rows with Cascade</title>

<info><![CDATA[

This example shows how to set up the panes so that values are pre-selected, while `-feature searchPanes.cascadePanes` *is* enabled. This is not something that was possible before version 2.0.0.

Here the Office column is being targeted and told to pre-select 'Edinburgh' and 'London'. This is done by setting the `-feature searchPanes.preSelect` option to be an array, and then setting the first object within that to contain a `rows` property, which is an array of strings representing the rows that are to be selected. The `column` property indicates which pane the selection is to be made in.

In the case that the row does not exist when SearchPanes tries to select it, be it because it was never present in the table or `-feature searchPanes.cascadePanes` has removed it, nothing will be selected and SearchPanes will move to the next pane. It is important therefore to set the preselections in the correct order when using `-feature searchPanes.cascadePanes`.
