<info><![CDATA[

This example demonstrates the `-feature searchPanes.viewTotal` option. This option allows the table to display how many values are being displayed, in relation to the total number of values in the table.

`-feature searchPanes.i18n.count` - this is the format of the count column when no filters have been applied to the table.

`-feature searchPanes.i18n.countFiltered` - this is the format of the count column when filters have been applied to the table.

`{total}` - This is the token which is replaced by the total count of that value in the table.

`{shown}` - This is the token which is replaced by the count of each value where that row is being displayed currently. 

The default for `-feature searchPanes.viewTotal` is `false`.
