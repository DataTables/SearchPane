<info><![CDATA[

This is the searchPanes extension for DataTables. It allows results to be filtered based on the values of columns.

This example demonstrates the `-init searchPanes.viewTotal` option. This option allows the table to display how many values are being displayed, in relation to the total number of values in the table.

`-init language.searchPanes.count` - this is the format of the count column when no filters have been applied to the table.

`-init language.searchPanes.countFiltered` - this is the format of the count column when filters have been applied to the table.

`{total}` - This is the token which is replaced by the total count of that value in the table.

`{shown}` - This is the token which is replaced by the count of each value where that row is being displayed currently. 

The default for `-init searchPanes.viewTotal` is `false`.
