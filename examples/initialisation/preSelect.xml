<info><![CDATA[

This is the searchPanes extension for DataTables. It allows results to be filtered based on the values of columns.

This example shows how to set up the panes so that values are pre-selected. Here the Office column is being targeted and told to pre-select 'Edinburgh' and 'London'. This is done by setting the `-init searchPanes.preSelect` option to be an array with an object that contains a `rows` property which indicates which rows are to be selected, and a `column` property which indicates which pane the selection should be made in.
