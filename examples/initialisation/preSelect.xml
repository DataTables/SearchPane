<info><![CDATA[

This example shows how to set up the panes so that values are pre-selected. Here the Office column is being targeted and told to pre-select 'Edinburgh' and 'London'. This is done by setting the `-feature searchPanes.preSelect` option to be an array with an object that contains a `rows` property which indicates which rows are to be selected, and a `column` property which indicates which pane the selection should be made in.
