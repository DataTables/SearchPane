		<![CDATA[
        As standard, SearchPanes will be displayed with the count column included in the table. However if the value of `-init searchPanes.hideCount` is set to 'true' then the count column will no longer be displayed in any of the panes.

		This is useful as a styling option for those that do not want to include the count column. 

        The count column can be hidden for individual of the panes by making use of the `-init columns.searchPanes.hideCount`.
