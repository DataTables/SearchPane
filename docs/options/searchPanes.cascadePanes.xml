		<![CDATA[
        As standard, SearchPanes will display all of the options for that column throughout its operation. When `-init searchPanes.cascadePanes` is set to `true`, the panes will remove options which are no longer present in the currently displayed DataTable. The cascade action will occur when a selection or a deselection is made in one of the panes.

		This is useful when dealing with large data sets with many different options as they are narrowed down accordingly as operation proceeds.
