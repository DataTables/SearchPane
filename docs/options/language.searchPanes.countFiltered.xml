            By setting the `-init language.searchPanes.countFiltered` to be a different string you change what will be displayed in the count column if the `-init searchPanes.viewTotal` option is set to true and filtering is taking place.

        The default value for the `-init language.searchPanes.countFiltered` paramater is `{shown} ({total})`.

		<![CDATA[
        As standard, SearchPanes will set the count column to display the total number of different values visible in the column when no filtering is taking place.
		
		The internals of searchPanes replace 2 strings when creating the output for the count column. The first is `{shown}`, this is the count for each different value that is currently being displayed in the DataTable. The other is `{total}`, this is the total count for each different value in the DataTable. When no filtering is taking place, `{total}` and `{count}` will both be replaced by the same value.

        Both of the above strings can be included in the count message although they will be the same when no filtering is taking place.
