		<description>
            By setting the `-init searchPanes.minRows` option to an integer, the number of unique options in a column needed to create a pane must be greater than this number.

	<default value="1">
        The default value for the `-init searchPanes.minRows` paramater is `1`. When this default value is in place it will mean that columns with only 1 unique value will not have a pane built. This makes sense as there is no point searching a column for the only value that is present as it will not affect search results.

		<![CDATA[
        As standard columns must have at least 2 different values present to have a pane displayed, although this is also affected by `-init searchPanes.thershold` and `-init columns.searchPanes.threshold`.

        By setting the `-init searchPanes.minRows` option to a different `-type integer` value, the number of different values in the columns must be greater than this value.
