			This option is an alias to `-feature searchPanes.clear`, which should be preferred when using DataTables 2+. It can be used to configure SearchPanes regardless of how the panes are inserted into the document (`-init layout` or `-button searchPanes`).

			Please refer to the documentation for `-feature searchPanes.clear` for full details of this option.
