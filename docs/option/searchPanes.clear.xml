			As standard, SearchPanes will display the buttons which allow selections to be cleared in individual panes and across all panes. When `-init searchPanes.clear` is set to `false`, the clear buttons will not be present.

			The `-init searchPanes.clear` functionality is useful when wanting to quickly deselect all of the options in a pane. It is useful to be able to disable these buttons, for example on smaller tables with less options it may be preferable to employ a custom user interface.
