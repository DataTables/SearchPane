            Setting the `-init searchPanes.i18n.clearMessage` option to a string of your choice allows the Clear All button to have custom text within it.
            
            This property is passed through an `-api i18n()` function.

			This option defines the text to be shown by the clear button in SearchPanes. It is a global setting that will impact all instances of SearchPanes on a DataTable (it should be noted that it is uncommon to have more than one instance!). The per-instance parameter is `-feature searchPanes.i18n.clearMessage`, which also defines the default.

			This option is useful as the `-init language` object can be loaded by Ajax, or set locally and define all language strings used by DataTables and its extensions.
