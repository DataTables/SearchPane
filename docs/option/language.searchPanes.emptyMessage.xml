			Empty cells will be represented in the panes by the string defined by this option. This is useful as it's a more user-friendly way than just having a blank cell. It is a global setting that will impact all instances of SearchPanes on a DataTable (it should be noted that it is uncommon to have more than one instance!). The per-instance parameter is `-feature searchPanes.i18n.emptyMessage`, which also defines the default.

			This option is useful as the `-init language` object can be loaded by Ajax, or set locally and define all language strings used by DataTables and its extensions.
