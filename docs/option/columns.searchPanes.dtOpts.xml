            The pane can be customised in the same way as a standard DataTable, as it is also an instance of DataTables. The panes properties can be defined within the `-init columns.searchPanes.dtOpts` object.

	<default value="undefined">
        The default value for the `-init columns.searchPanes.dtOpts` parameter is `-type undefined`. When this default value is in place the defaults for SearchPanes are applied.

		<![CDATA[
		As standard, SearchPanes will overwrite the options for that column defined by the SearchPanes code with the options defined in `-init columns.searchPanes.dtOpts`. As Standard SearchPanes internal DataTable has a `-init layout` property set to show only the table, if you are added paging or something visual then you must also modify the `-init layout` option.

		This functionality is useful as it allows all of the standard DataTables options and API methods to be available to all of the the panes, either globally or individually.

		All of the panes can be altered by using the `-init searchPanes.dtOpts` option.
