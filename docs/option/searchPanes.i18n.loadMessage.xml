            The `-init searchPanes.i18n.loadMessage` is displayed to the user in the SearchPanes container when the panes are loading and have not yet been displayed. This is typically only seen for large data sets or when using server-side processing.

        As standard, SearchPanes will display a message in the div that is meant to hold the panes once the table has been initialised and the panes are still loading. If a  custom message has been declared then this will be shown in the place of the default message.

        This option allows direct configuration on the language options for the SearchPanes instance. At this time using `language.searchPanes.loadMessage` has the same effect as setting this option. If both are provided, this will take preference, We've made this change for consistency in our APIs moving forward.
