		<![CDATA[
			This option is deprecated from version 1.2.1+. It was replaced by `-init columns.searchPanes.viewCount` to maintain consistency with `-init searchPanes.viewTotal`. For now this option can still be used, but it will be removed in the future.
			
			As standard, SearchPanes will be displayed with the count column included in the table. However if the value of `-init searchPanes.hideCount` is set to `true` then the count column won't be displayed in any of the panes.

			The count column can be hidden for individual panes by the `-init columns.searchPanes.hideCount` option.
