		<description>
            By setting the `-init searchPanes.hideCount` option to `true` the count column will be hidden in all of the panes.
        </description>

	<default value="false">
        The default value for the `-init searchPanes.hideCount` parameter is `false`, meaning that as standard the count column will be included in the panes.
	</default>

	<deprecated>
		This option is deprecated from version 1.2.1+. It was replaced by `-init columns.searchPanes.viewCount` to maintain consistency with `-init searchPanes.viewTotal`. For now this option can still be used, but it will be removed in the future.

			This option is an alias to `-feature searchPanes.hideCount`, which should be preferred when using DataTables 2+. It can be used to configure SearchPanes regardless of how the panes are inserted into the document (`-init layout` or `-button searchPanes`).

			Please refer to the documentation for `-feature searchPanes.hideCount` for full details of this option.
