		<![CDATA[
			SearchPanes will set the count column to display the total number of different values visible in the column when no filtering is taking place. It is a global setting that will impact all instances of SearchPanes on a DataTable (it should be noted that it is uncommon to have more than one instance!). The per-instance parameter is `-feature searchPanes.i18n.countFiltered`, which also defines the default.

			This option is useful as the `-init language` object can be loaded by Ajax, or set locally and define all language strings used by DataTables and its extensions.
