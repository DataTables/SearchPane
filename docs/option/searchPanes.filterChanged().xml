            This function is called every time the number of SearchPanes options that have been selected changes. As default this is used to update the SearchPanes title (set using the `-init language.searchPanes.title` config option alongside an `-api i18n()` api call).
            
            The SearchPanes button also uses this configuration option to update the button text to reflect the selection numbers (text is set using `-init language.searchPanes.collapse` and an `-api i18n()` api call).

            The context of the function is the DataTables instance, meaning that API methods can be called directly from within the function. For example...

            ```
            this.i18n(...);
            ```

            This function could of course be used to perform other functionality, although this is down to the user requirements.
