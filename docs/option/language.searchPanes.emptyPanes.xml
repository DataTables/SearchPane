			SearchPanes will display the message defined here in the `-tag div` that is meant to hold the panes if there are none to display. If the value of this option is set to null then the div will not be shown.

			It is a global setting that will impact all instances of SearchPanes on a DataTable (it should be noted that it is uncommon to have more than one instance!). The per-instance parameter is `-feature searchPanes.i18n.emptyPanes`, which also defines the default.

			This option is useful as the `-init language` object can be loaded by Ajax, or set locally and define all language strings used by DataTables and its extensions.
