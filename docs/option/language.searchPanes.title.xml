            As standard `-init searchPanes.i18n.title` is simply a string that contains a replacement for the number of selections that have been made.

        <description>
            It is possible to set the value of `-init searchPanes.i18n.title` to an object that would allow for the actual text to also change as the number of selections increases.

	<default value="Filters Active - %d">
        The default value for the `-init searchPanes.i18n.title` parameter is `Filters Active - %d`.

		<![CDATA[
		SearchPanes will set the title to display the number of filters in the style of the following 'Filters Active - %d'. This property allows that message to be configured.

		It is a global setting that will impact all instances of SearchPanes on a DataTable (it should be noted that it is uncommon to have more than one instance!). The per-instance parameter is `-feature searchPanes.i18n.title`, which also defines the default.

		This option is useful as the `-init language` object can be loaded by Ajax, or set locally and define all language strings used by DataTables and its extensions.
