		<description>
            The `-init searchPanes.panes.preSelect` array allows custom options to be preSelected for Custom Panes. The array is to be populated with strings that match the `-init searchPanes.panes.options.label` string.
        </description>
	</type>

	<default value="Undefined">
        The default value of `-init searchPanes.panes.preSelect` is undefined as by default there should be no preSelected options.
    </default>

	<deprecated since="2.0.0">
		This option is deprecated from version 2.0.0+. It was replaced by `-init searchPanes.preSelect` which allowed the order that the selections were made in to be defined. This allowed preselecting to become compatible with `-init searchPanes.cascadePanes`.
	</deprecated>

		<![CDATA[
			This option is an alias to `-feature searchPanes.panes.preSelect`, which should be preferred when using DataTables 2+. It can be used to configure SearchPanes regardless of how the panes are inserted into the document (`-init layout` or `-button searchPanes`).

			Please refer to the documentation for `-feature searchPanes.panes.preSelect` for full details of this option.
