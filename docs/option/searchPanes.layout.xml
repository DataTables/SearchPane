            This property has a variety of possible values. The default value is `'auto'` When this is in place, SearchPanes will fit the panes to their best fit on the page, including responsively. By setting the `-init searchPanes.layout` to `columns-%d` the searchPanes are displayed in columns, with %d panes in each column.
        </description>

	<default value="'auto'">
        The default value for the `-init searchPanes.layout` parameter is `'auto'`. This will allow SearchPanes to fit the panes optimally depending on the size of the display. 
    </default>

			This option is an alias to `-feature searchPanes.layout`, which should be preferred when using DataTables 2+. It can be used to configure SearchPanes regardless of how the panes are inserted into the document (`-init layout` or `-button searchPanes`).

			Please refer to the documentation for `-feature searchPanes.layout` for full details of this option.
