	<default value="undefined">
        The default value for the `-init searchPanes.dtOpts` parameter is `-type undefined`. When this default value is in place the defaults for SearchPanes are applied.

		<![CDATA[
			As standard, SearchPanes will overwrite the options defined by the SearchPanes code with the options defined in `-init searchPanes.dtOpts`. As Standard SearchPanes internal DataTable has a `-init dom` property of only `t`, meaning that if you are added paging or something visual then you must also modify the `-init dom` property.

			By overwriting this value in the initialisation, the panes can be customised as much as a standard DataTables. 

			This functionality is useful as it allows all of the standard DataTables options and API Methods to be available to the panes.

			Individual panes can be altered by using the `-init columns.searchPanes.dtOpts` option.
