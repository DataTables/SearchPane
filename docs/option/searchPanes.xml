		<description>
			By setting the `-init searchPanes` option to true, a series of Panes will be displayed to aid searching the associated DataTable.

			This is a short-cut option to enable searchPanes with the default configuration options. Customisations can be made by giving this parameter as an object.

	<type type="object">
		<description>
			By setting the `-init searchPanes` option to an object, SearchPanes will be enabled for the relevant DataTable, with the SearchPanes defaults (`$.fn.dataTable.SearchPanes.defaults`) extended and overwritten by any conflicting options provided in the object as defined by the programmer.
		</description>
	</type>

	<default value="false">
		The default value for the `-init searchPanes` parameter is `false`. When this default value is in place no panes will be displayed and you will display a standard DataTable along with any other extensions that are in use.
	</default>

			This option is an alias to `-feature searchPanes`, which should be preferred when using DataTables 2+. It can be used to configure SearchPanes regardless of how the panes are inserted into the document (`-init layout` or `-button searchPanes`).

			Please refer to the documentation for `-feature searchPanes` for full details of this option.
