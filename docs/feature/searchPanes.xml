			By setting the `-init searchPanes` option to true, a series of Panes will be displayed to aid searching the associated DataTable.

			This is a short-cut option to enable searchPanes with the default configuration options. Customisations can be made by giving this parameter as an object.

		<description>
			By setting the `-init searchPanes` option to an object, SearchPanes will be enabled for the relevant DataTable, with the SearchPanes defaults (`$.fn.dataTable.SearchPanes.defaults`) extended and overwritten by any conflicting options provided in the object as defined by the programmer.

	<default value="false">
		The default value for the `-init searchPanes` parameter is `false`. When this default value is in place no panes will be displayed and you will display a standard DataTable along with any other extensions that are in use.

		<![CDATA[
			SearchPanes is an extension that allows for clearer more accessible searching functionality. 

			When a selection is made in one of the associated panes, the DataTable will be searched for records that meet the criteria of the selections made in the panes. These records will then be displayed while all of the records that do not meet the criteria will not be included in the DataTable.

			SearchPanes can be enabled through the `-init layout` option with the `searchPanes` feature name, or the `-button searchPanes` buttons, which accepts configuration options as a `config` parameter.
