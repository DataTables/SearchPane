	<description>
		This method provides the ability to resize the panes to fill the SearchPanes container appropriately. SearchPanes uses this method itself when `-init searchPanes.layout` is left at it's default value of `auto`. For any other value of layout, this method will not do anything.

		This method should be called when initialising and inserting SearchPanes through the API, immediately after the container has been inserted, otherwise the panes will display in a single column. It can also be called at any other time to attempt to resize the panes to their best fit, although SearchPanes should do this automatically.
